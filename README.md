# Traffic Volumes and Collisions in Toronto
1
## Overview
This repository contains a paper that investigates traffic collisions that occurred between January 2020 and September 2023 in the City of Toronto. By exploring the trends of these different types of traffic collisions in terms of frequency, fatalities, and location, I found that the total number of accidents is on the rise. I had to wonder if the volume of traffic on different roads at different times of the day was a factor in traffic collisions. The results showed that the number of traffic collisions goes up during peak traffic flow times. Therefore; pedestrians and drivers should pay more attention to road safety and government departments should take further measures to enhance road safety issues. The data used in this paper can be found on the Toronto Open Data Portal.
